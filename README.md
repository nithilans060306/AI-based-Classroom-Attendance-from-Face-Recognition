## Face Recognition using OpenCV and dlib
This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition libraries.
It can detect and recognize faces from both images and live camera feeds by comparing them to known images in a training folder.

### Features:
- Detects faces in real-time using your webcam or input images.
- Encodes and stores known faces for recognition.
- Displays the name of recognized individuals on the video/image output.
- Easy to extend — just add more images to the TrainingImage folder.

### Requirements:
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install dependencies:
